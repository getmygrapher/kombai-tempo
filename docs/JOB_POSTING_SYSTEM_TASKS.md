# Job Posting System – Frontend Task Breakdown (Kombai Agent)

Purpose
- Provide a precise, implementation-ready task list focused on Job_Posting_System_Flow.md.
- Enforce proper routing (React Router, declarative) and UI consistency across the app.
- Align with Milestone 5 in the milestone plan and the PRD.

Source Docs
- Job system flow: Job_Posting_System_Flow.md
- Milestone plan: Milestone_Plan.md (see Milestone 5 – Job Posting System)
- PRD: getmygrapher_prd.md
- Frontend audit: frontend-only audit.md

Context Snapshot (what exists vs missing)
- Exists (per audit)
  - Job wizard scaffolding: JobCreationWizard.tsx and steps under components/jobs/steps/*
  - Discovery UI: JobFeed, JobFilters, JobCard, JobDetailModal
  - Dashboard scaffolding: MyJobs/JobDashboard, ApplicationsList (mock actions)
  - Data: data/jobPostingMockData.ts
- Gaps / To implement or improve
  - Routing: React Router v7 not used app-wide; jobs pages must be routed (feed, detail, wizard, manage)
  - Validation: ad-hoc; adopt react-hook-form + zod for all job forms
  - Location: add shared LocationInput with GPS + (stub) map preview, PIN validation
  - Proximity sort: currently mocked; prepare service API contracts (stubs) and utilities for distance
  - Drafts/autosave: persist wizard drafts; resume flow
  - Accessibility and UI consistency: ensure MUI theme tokens, a11y, skeletons/disabled states
  - Store: dedicated jobs store slice(s) for wizard and discovery paging/infinite scroll

Design System and UI Consistency Rules (apply to all new/updated components)
- MUI v7 with project theme tokens: src/theme/index.ts palette, spacing, typography.
- Use styled() from @mui/material/styles; avoid inline style objects.
- Spacing: theme.spacing(n); Radius: theme.shape.borderRadius; Shadows: theme.shadows[x].
- Colors: palette.primary/secondary/success/warning/error/info; greys from palette.grey.
- Loading: MUI Skeleton or CircularProgress; Disabled states: set disabled and aria-disabled.
- Accessibility: label/id for inputs; aria-describedby for help/error; keyboard focus visible.
- Mobile-first: verify at 360–400px; use useMediaQuery for adaptations.

Route Map (declarative, deep-linkable)
- /jobs → JobFeed (default discovery list)
- /jobs/new → JobCreationWizard (redirect to /jobs/new/basic)
- /jobs/new/basic → Step 1
- /jobs/new/schedule → Step 2
- /jobs/new/budget → Step 3
- /jobs/new/review → Step 4
- /jobs/:jobId → JobDetailView/Modal route
- /jobs/manage → MyJobs dashboard (Active/Drafts/Expired/Completed)
- /jobs/manage/:jobId/applications → Applications management for a job

Epic A — Routing & App Shell Integration
A1. Introduce jobs routes (React Router declarative)
- Files: main.tsx, src/App.GetMyGrapher.tsx
- Actions
  - Add routes listed above. Use code-splitting (React.lazy/Suspense).
  - Integrate BottomNavigation to navigate via routes (not Zustand-only tab state).
  - If auth guard exists, ensure /jobs/new and /jobs/manage are protected; /jobs and /jobs/:jobId public read.
- Acceptance criteria
  - Hitting routes directly renders correct screens.
  - Bottom nav and “Post Job” FAB navigate to /jobs/new/basic.
  - App boots and jobs routes cooperate with existing providers (Theme, QueryClient).
- Dependencies
  - Milestone 0 routing/provider foundation; Auth guard from onboarding epic.

A2. Link Home and Search to Jobs routing
- Files: src/components/home/*, src/components/navigation/BottomNavigation.tsx
- Actions
  - Ensure “Jobs” tab navigates to /jobs and “Post Job” action navigates to /jobs/new.
- Acceptance criteria

Implementation Order & Dependencies
1) Epic A (Routing) + B (Types/Services/Store)
2) Epic C (Wizard) with G (Validation/Drafts) and H (LocationInput)
3) Epic D (Discovery) and E (Detail + Apply)
4) Epic F (My Jobs)
5) Epic I (Analytics) and J (QA/A11y/Perf) ongoing

Acceptance Criteria Summary (global)
- All job routes deep-link and render expected screens with guarded access where needed.
- Wizard uses react-hook-form + zod, with draft autosave and resume; validation and UX are consistent and accessible.
- Discovery feed supports infinite scroll, pull-to-refresh, and URL-driven filters; proximity sorting prepared.
- My Jobs dashboard supports CRUD-like actions (mocked) and application status changes with optimistic UI.
- UI adheres to theme tokens and accessibility standards; skeletons and disabled states are consistent.

Security & Privacy Checklist (apply across tasks)
- Input sanitization and client-side validation for all fields (title, description, budget, location).
- No secrets in repo; service adapters are swappable for backend.
- Location usage is explicit with user consent; allow “hide exact location” toggle on job post (UI stub).
- Authorization checks: manage-only for own jobs (UI enforced; service stubs respect userId in future).

Deliverables Review (Definition of Done)
- Components and utilities implemented per file list; typed with TS.
- Routing integrated; no dead routes; URL is source of truth for navigation and filters.
- Tests passing; manual mobile checks done; lint clean; CI build green.
- Analytics events implemented; basic dashboards/console logging acceptable for dev.
