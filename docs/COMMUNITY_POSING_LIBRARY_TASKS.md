Design System and UI Consistency Rules (apply to all new/updated components)
- Use MUI v7 with project theme tokens from src/theme/index.ts.
- Styling: use styled() and sx with theme values; no hardcoded colors.
  - Colors: theme.palette.primary/secondary/info/success/warning/error and palette.grey.
  - Spacing: theme.spacing(n)
  - Typography: theme.typography variants
  - Radius: theme.shape.borderRadius
  - Shadows: theme.shadows[x]
- Accessibility:
  - Form labels/ids; aria-* attributes; focus ring visible; keyboard navigable.
- Responsiveness:
  - Mobile-first (360–400px) and scalable to tablet/desktop via responsive MUI Grid/Stack.
- Loading/Empty/Error:
  - Use MUI Skeleton, CircularProgress, Alert as appropriate.

Epic A — Routing & App Shell
A1. Add Community route group (React Router v7, declarative)
- Files: main.tsx, src/App.GetMyGrapher.tsx
- Actions
  - Define nested routes:
    - /community → redirect to /community/browse
    - /community/browse → CommunityLibraryPage (wraps CommunityLibraryBrowser + FilterBottomSheet)
    - /community/pose/:id → PoseDetailPage (wraps PoseDetailView + CameraSettingsCard + CommentsSection)
    - /community/contribute → ContributionWizard (multi-step: upload → EXIF review → pose details → review & submit)
    - /community/moderation → ModerationDashboard (queue + detail review)
    - Optional: /community/mine → MyContributionsPage (list, statuses)
  - Guard: redirect unauthenticated users to /onboarding/welcome (match app standard).
  - Bottom navigation: “Community” tab routes to /community/browse and preserves active highlighting.
- Acceptance criteria
  - Navigating to each community route renders correct screen in app layout.
  - /community redirects to /community/browse.
  - Deep links to /community/pose/:id render the pose with valid loading states.

A2. Community layout scaffolding

Routing Changes (implementation notes)
- src/App.GetMyGrapher.tsx
  - Add nested routes for /community/browse, /community/pose/:id, /community/contribute, /community/moderation (guard).
  - Keep existing /community route but redirect it to /community/browse.
- main.tsx
  - Ensure /community resolves correctly with redirect to /community/browse (mirroring existing /availability redirect).

Security & Privacy Checklist (apply across tasks)
- Input sanitization for comments and forms.
- Image file constraints (type/size) enforced client-side; do not expose secrets.
- Clear moderation status surfacing; reporting flow non-abusive and rate-limited (stub note).
- Respect future backend-driven visibility rules in detail pages (owner vs public view).

Implementation Order & Dependencies
1) Epic A (Routing & Layout)
2) Epic F (Service stubs) + Epic G (Store)
3) Epic B (Browse) and Epic C (Detail & interactions)
4) Epic D (Contribution wizard)
